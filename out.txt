43 ACCHASING ANU MANEDULALING PIXELS

On Line 44 we manipulate the top-left pixel in the im
age, which i located at cuordinate (0,0) anid swt it to have
avalue of (0, 0, 286), If we wer reading this pixel value
in RGB format, we would have a value of O for rel, 0 for
Wl abn for blue, thus makiny, it pure blue color

 

    

 

a2 I mentioned above, we nen to take special
care when working with OpenCY, Our pixels are actually
Stoned in BCR format, aot RGB format

We actually read this pixel ws 255 for red, 0 for green, and.
0 for blue, making it « rel cole, not a blue color.

Alter setting the top left pixel to have a red color on Line
a4, we then grab the pixel value and print it back to con
sole on Lines 15 und 16, just to demonstrate that we have
indeed successfully changed the color of the pixel.

Accessing and setting, a single pixel value is simple enough,
but what if we wanted lo use NumPy’s weray slicinp, capa-
bilities to access larger rectangular portions of the Image?
The code below demonstrates how we can do this:

4 sonar = saga {8:10 92205)
 amngeto:s00, 0:4001 = co, 268.

On line 47 we grab a 100 100 pixel region of the imaye.
In fact, this is the top-left corner of the image! In order te
grab chunks of an image, NumPy expects we provide tour
